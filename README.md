# Acknowledgment
This react web application is not an idea of mine. I do not claim it as my own work. It is inspired by the Youtuber Dom The Engineer (Here's his youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@domtheengineer and github https://github.com/DLabbate/stock-dashboard respectively) I once again do not claim this as mine. I simply changed certain aspect of the code such as the color scheme, font, and positioning of some components.
