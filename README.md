# Acknowledgment
This web application is not an idea of mine. I do not claim it as mine. The orginal code is from the Youtuber Dom the Engineer (here is his youtube and github channel respectively, https://www.youtube.com/@domtheengineer and https://github.com/DLabbate/stock-dashboard). I simply change some aspect of the code such as the color scheme, font, and position of certain components.
